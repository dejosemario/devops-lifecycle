# DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps is more than just a set of tools‚Äîit's a cultural shift that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams. The goal is to improve application development by automating processes, ensuring continuous quality checks, and maintaining constant monitoring and feedback loops.

## üîß Core DevOps Principles

- **Collaboration**: Bridging the gap between development, operations, and QA teams.
- **Automation**: Streamlining repetitive tasks such as testing, integration, and deployment.
- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating code integration and delivery pipelines.
- **Monitoring & Feedback**: Using real-time data to improve performance, security, and user experience.

## üîÅ DevOps Lifecycle Stages

1. **Planning**: Teams collaborate to define requirements, set goals, and outline the roadmap using agile methodologies.
2. **Defining**: Specific features, architecture, and workflows are clearly documented and aligned with business needs.
3. **Designing**: System architecture and interface designs are created with scalability and maintainability in mind.
4. **Building**: Developers write and compile code, using version control and automated build systems to ensure consistency.
5. **Testing**: Automated and manual tests validate the functionality, security, and performance of the application.
6. **Deploying**: The application is delivered to production environments using infrastructure as code and deployment automation.
